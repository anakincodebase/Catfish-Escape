## Catfish Escape
A simple classic roguelike dungeon crawler made with pygame and Python 3.13 for the Pyweek game jam. Content was unfortunately drastically cut short due to time constraints and life getting in the way.

To run, you must have pygame installed and execute run_game.py.

### Controls
Ingame controls use mouse only. Click things to attack, walk over things to interact with them.
